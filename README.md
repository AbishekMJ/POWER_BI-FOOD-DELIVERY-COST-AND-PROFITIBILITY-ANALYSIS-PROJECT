# Food Delivery Cost and Profitability Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project involves the development of an interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze food delivery costs and profitability. The dashboard provides insights into various financial metrics and operational efficiencies, helping stakeholders make informed decisions.

## Features

- **Cost Analysis**: Visualizes total delivery costs, including breakdowns by different categories.
- **Profitability Metrics**: Displays profit margins and comparisons between actual and simulated profitability.
- **Revenue Tracking**: Monitors revenue trends and identifies key drivers.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Offers interactive charts and tables for detailed exploration of financial data.

## Data

- **Delivery Fee**: Cost associated with delivering food.
- **Delivery Amount**: Total amount charged for delivery.
- **Payment Processing Fee**: Fees incurred for processing payments.
- **Discount Amount**: Total discounts applied.
- **Revenue**: Total revenue generated.
- **Total Costs**: Aggregated costs including delivery fees, processing fees, and other expenses.
- **Profit**: Calculated profit from the food delivery operations.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI**: For creating interactive dashboards and reports.
- **Python (Optional)**: For advanced data manipulation and custom visualizations.

## Installation

1. **Power BI Desktop**: Download and install Power BI Desktop from [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop).
2. **Dataset**: Ensure you have the required dataset in CSV, Excel, or another compatible format.
3. **Python (Optional)**: Install Python and necessary libraries if custom Python scripts are used.

## Usage

1. **Import Data**: Load the dataset into Power BI.
2. **Create Measures**: Define DAX measures to calculate total costs, revenue, and profit.
3. **Build Visuals**: Use Power BIâ€™s visualizations to create charts, tables, and dashboards.
4. **Interact**: Use interactive filters and slicers to explore the data and derive insights.

## Example Visualizations

- **Bar Charts**: Displaying total revenue, costs, and profit.
- **Pie Charts**: Showing the proportion of different cost components.
- **Line Charts**: Tracking profitability trends over time.
- **KDE Plots**: Comparing actual and simulated profitability (if Python scripts are used).
